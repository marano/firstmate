# Single owner of a ship task's mode-specific "Definition of done" block.
# Sourced by bin/fm-brief.sh, which renders it into a generated ship brief, and by
# bin/fm-promote.sh, which renders it into the ship instructions a promoted scout
# receives. Both paths must hand the worker the same contract: a promoted
# no-mistakes worker that never received the ask-user escalation rule or the
# `--yes` ban is the exact delivery hole this single owner exists to close.
# fm_dod_block <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> <task-id> prints the block on
# stdout with no trailing blank line. The caller validates the mode; an unknown
# mode is refused rather than silently rendered as the pipeline contract.
# The block opens with the fixed machine-readable "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>"
# line that bin/fm-spawn.sh checks a ship brief against.
# The two PR-based blocks require a non-draft pull request, read back from the
# forge, before the done report; a lane that deliberately holds a draft declares
# a paused wait instead. bin/fm-pr-check.sh refuses to arm merge monitoring on a
# draft through the reading bin/fm-pr-lib.sh owns.
# This file is the one owner of the no-mistakes `--intent` contract: only the
# brief's `## Captain's intent` subsection plus later captain words, never
# `## Firstmate spec` and never the worker's own tradeoffs.
# Author the subsection body and later relays as the actual words, without
# adding speaker labels or direct address: the heading supplies provenance and
# is not part of --intent. A legacy mixed Task instead marks each captain line
# with `[captain] `; the selector returns its words, not that metadata prefix.
# Previously stored speaker labels remain readable for compatibility only.
# Never scrub literal examples or other content the captain actually supplied.
# The string passed must be self-sufficient - it plus the codebase reconstructs
# roughly the same specification - so a report, decision, or PR the intent
# refers to is written into it as substance, never left as a pointer.
# bin/fm-brief.sh scaffolds those two `# Task` subsections; bin/fm-spawn.sh and
# bin/fm-promote.sh refuse leftover `{TASK}` / `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}` placeholders
# and a `## Captain's intent` line opening with a Captain label or address
# through the helpers below. Other mentions of `--intent` point here rather than
# restating the rule.
# Every heredoc here stays outside a command substitution: `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ...)`
# breaks parsing of the whole file on Bash 3.2 (tests/fm-brief.test.sh).
# fm_brief_worker_role owns the ship/scout role scope. bin/fm-spawn.sh is its one
# emitter, supplying it first in every ship/scout launch brief and never to a
# secondmate charter. It names the one task-owned steering inbox without
# relaxing isolation from every other home's endpoint namespace. Like
# fm_brief_intent_overlay it is a distinctly titled launch section that states
# its own precedence, so a brief or project instruction that authors a
# conflicting role is superseded rather than duplicated.
# fm_ship_rule_one owns the mode-specific first ship safety rule shared by an
# ordinary ship brief and the durable contract written during scout promotion.
# This file is also the one owner of the PR-bound done rule: a PR-based mode
# (no-mistakes, direct-PR) must never authorize any `done:` status template whose
# body carries no PR URL, because such a line reads to the supervisor exactly like
# the delivered one and invites an undelivered task to be recorded as delivered.
# fm_dod_unbound_done_templates is the checker, fm_dod_assert_done_pr_bound the
# guard, and fm_dod_block runs that guard over its own output so a reintroduced
# bare gate refuses brief generation instead of reaching a worker. local-only is
# exempt by design: its `done: ready in branch` line is correct with no PR.
# The no-mistakes implementation-complete handoff that replaced the bare gate uses
# `blocked:` rather than the declared-wait verb because firstmate itself must act
# to clear it: bin/fm-classify-lib.sh surfaces a blocked span immediately, while a
# declared wait is absorbed and only re-surfaces on FM_PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS
# (4h by default), which would delay every no-mistakes handoff by up to that long.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=no-mistakes
${delivers_block}This task ships **no-mistakes**: it has exactly one \`done:\`, that line carries the PR URL, and you write it only after the pipeline reports CI green.
Committing the implementation is not done.
Neither is your project's own gate: its CI script, test suite, lint, or build is evidence for the pipeline to consume, never the validation this contract requires, and never a substitute for the PR.
When the implementation is committed on your branch, append \`blocked: implementation committed <sha>, needs the instruction to run /no-mistakes\` to the status file and stop.
That line asks firstmate to act and is not a completion; it is not a declared wait either, because this one does not clear on its own.
Firstmate will then instruct you to run /no-mistakes to validate and ship a PR.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and \`no-mistakes axi run --help\` plus the \`help\` lines in each \`axi\` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
When starting no-mistakes, pass \`--intent\` as only this brief's \`## Captain's intent\` subsection body, not its heading, plus any later words the captain actually said.
Preserve the actual words without adding speaker labels or direct address; the subsection heading supplies provenance outside the pipeline input.
For a legacy brief with no such subsection, include only words on lines marked \`[captain] \`, excluding that metadata prefix; never copy its mixed \`# Task\` wholesale.
If it has no provenance-marked captain words, stop and ask firstmate instead of starting no-mistakes.
Do not include \`## Firstmate spec\`, later Firstmate build constraints, or your own decisions and tradeoffs.
The \`--intent\` string you pass must be self-sufficient: that string plus the codebase must let a reader reconstruct roughly the same specification, without depending on a separate report, a PR, or context that lives only in this conversation.
When the captain's intent refers to a report, decision, or PR ("do items 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the report"), write the substance of the referenced items into \`--intent\` in the captain's terms, not only the pointer; that substance is the captain's ask by reference, while Firstmate's build instructions and your own decisions still stay out.
This replaces the no-mistakes skill's advice to enrich \`--intent\` with decisions and tradeoffs; that advice does not apply to Firstmate-dispatched work.
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.
Do not announce the pipeline and stop: the \`working:\` line saying the run started is written after your first \`no-mistakes axi run --wait\` call returns, and names the run id it returned.

One drive call blocks until the next gate or outcome, which routinely outlives what your harness lets a single command run: Claude Code kills a command at ten minutes maximum, while one fix round is capped around thirty minutes and up to three rounds chain.
So drive with \`no-mistakes axi run --wait\` and answer gates with \`no-mistakes axi respond --wait\`; \`--wait\` bounds the hold so the call returns a structured result within your harness's command cap instead of running out the clock.
An elapsed wait is a normal structured return, not a failure: reattach by issuing the same drive call again.
Never run a \`no-mistakes axi status\` loop to watch a run progress; a single \`axi status\` call as a diagnostic, such as rule 7's daemon-error check, stays allowed.
If your harness offers a native wait-without-model-calls facility, such as Claude Code's \`Monitor\` tool, use it in place of a reattach loop.
Any such wait - a native wait facility, a long sleep, or an elapsed \`--wait\` you are about to reissue - is a wait rule 4 makes you declare before you stop.
Any residual sleep-and-recheck fallback must sleep at least 120 seconds inside a single call, never spin.
Never poll the PR's own check status yourself with \`gh-axi\`, \`gh\`, or an equivalent - the pipeline's own CI step already reports the CI-ready point that ends your job.
A killed or timed-out call is never evidence the daemon died: the daemon accepts your response immediately and runs the round in the background, so the call was only ever waiting for a read while the run kept working.
Reattach and keep going rather than reporting the pipeline blocked; rule 7 owns the checks that decide when a pipeline block is real.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate using rule 6's ask-user format and stop.
  Firstmate applies \`ask-user-authority\` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with \`no-mistakes axi respond\` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- NEVER pass \`--yes\` (or \`-y\`) to \`no-mistakes axi run\` or \`no-mistakes axi respond\`. It is banned fleet-wide.
  It auto-resolves every gate including ask-user findings with no escalation, and answering your own ask-user finding is a hard rule violation.

After /no-mistakes reports CI green (the CI-ready return point - do not wait for it to keep monitoring in the background until merge), read the PR back from the forge and confirm it is not a draft (\`gh pr view <url> --json isDraft\` must print false); if it is a draft, mark it ready with \`gh-axi pr ready <number> -R <owner>/<repo>\`.
A draft cannot be merged, so a done report on one leaves the merge unasked and merge monitoring refuses to arm.
Then append \`done: PR {url} checks green run={run-id}\` and stop. You are finished.
If you deliberately keep the PR a draft, append \`paused: {why the draft is held}\` instead of done.
\`{run-id}\` is the concrete no-mistakes run you drove to that green result, exactly as \`axi run\`/\`axi respond\` printed it - paste that id, never a description of the command you ran. "Applied via axi respond" is a report about a command, not evidence about the commit: a \`done:\` line with no run id is not a complete report, so do not send one.
